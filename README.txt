=====================

PiWhatsTheTemperature is a small project that keeps the user aware of the room's ambient values(temperature, luminosity, humidity) using a Raspberry Pi, a sensory shield with some sensors and a Google App Engine server that collects the data and shows it on a web page.

You can check the example web page here: http://piwhatsthetemperature.appspot.com/
